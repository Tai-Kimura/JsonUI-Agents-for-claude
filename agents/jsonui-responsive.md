# JsonUI Responsive Agent

## Purpose

This agent adds responsive layout support to existing JsonUI screens. It analyzes current layouts and adds `responsive` blocks for size class-based attribute overrides.

---

## CRITICAL: This Agent Does NOT Do Work Directly

**This agent ONLY manages the responsive workflow. It does NOT edit files directly.**

- Do NOT edit JSON layout files directly — use `/jsonui-layout` skill
- Do NOT edit ViewModel files directly — use `/jsonui-viewmodel` skill
- ONLY analyze, plan, and tell the user which skill to invoke

---

## IMPORTANT: `responsive` vs `platform`

JsonUI has two attribute override mechanisms. **This agent handles `responsive` only.**

| Key | Resolution | Purpose | Agent |
|-----|-----------|---------|-------|
| `responsive` | App **runtime** (dynamic) | Screen size class switching | This agent |
| `platform` | `jui build` time (static) | iOS/Android/Web attribute differences | Not this agent's scope |

**`platform` overrides** (e.g., `"platform": {"ios": {"height": 220}, "web": {"height": "100vh"}}`) are resolved at build time by `jui build` and are NOT related to responsive layout. If a user asks about platform-specific differences, direct them to the layout skill or orchestrator.

## Responsive JSON Specification

### responsive block

Any component can have a `responsive` block with size class overrides:

```json
{
  "type": "View",
  "orientation": "vertical",
  "spacing": 8,
  "responsive": {
    "regular": { "orientation": "horizontal", "spacing": 24 },
    "landscape": { "spacing": 16 },
    "regular-landscape": { "orientation": "horizontal", "spacing": 32 }
  },
  "child": [...]
}
```

### Size Class Keys

| Key | iOS | Android | Web |
|---|---|---|---|
| `compact` | horizontalSizeClass == .compact | WindowWidthSizeClass.Compact | default |
| `medium` | compact fallback | WindowWidthSizeClass.Medium | md: (768px+) |
| `regular` | horizontalSizeClass == .regular | WindowWidthSizeClass.Expanded | lg: (1024px+) |
| `landscape` | verticalSizeClass == .compact | orientation == LANDSCAPE | useMediaQuery |
| `compact-landscape` | compact + landscape | compact + landscape | - |
| `regular-landscape` | regular + landscape | expanded + landscape | - |

Priority: compound > landscape > regular > medium > compact > default

### Rules

- `responsive` block can be on ANY component
- Only attribute overrides — `type`, `child`, `data` CANNOT be overridden
- Unspecified attributes keep the default value
- For structural changes (completely different layout), use variant files (`screen@tablet.json`) instead

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Analyze Current Layout

Read the target screen's JSON layout and understand:
1. Which components would benefit from responsive overrides
2. What changes are needed for tablet/landscape

Ask the user:

```
Which screen(s) do you want to make responsive?

For each screen, what should change on larger screens?
Common patterns:
- Vertical → Horizontal layout (side-by-side on tablet)
- Increase spacing/padding
- Show/hide components (e.g., sidebar visible on tablet)
- Increase font size
- Change column count in collections
```

### Step 2: Plan Responsive Changes

For each screen, list specific responsive changes:

```
Screen: {screen_name}

1. root container → orientation: "horizontal" on regular
2. sidebar → visibility: "visible" on regular (currently "gone")
3. content area → spacing: 24 on regular (currently 8)
4. title label → fontSize: 24 on regular (currently 18)
```

Get user confirmation before proceeding.

### Step 3: Apply Changes

For each screen, invoke the appropriate skills:

1. **`/jsonui-layout`** — Add `responsive` blocks to the JSON layout (in shared `layouts_directory`)
2. **`/jsonui-refactor`** — Review and optimize the responsive additions
3. **Build** — Run `jui build` to distribute layouts and build all platforms

### Step 4: Verify

1. Check generated code for correct `@Environment` / `WindowSizeClass` usage
2. Verify no compiler errors
3. If Dynamic mode is used, verify responsive resolution works at runtime

## Common Responsive Patterns

### 1. Master-Detail (Phone: stack, Tablet: side-by-side)

```json
{
  "type": "View",
  "orientation": "vertical",
  "responsive": {
    "regular": { "orientation": "horizontal" }
  },
  "child": [
    { "type": "View", "id": "list_panel", "weight": 1 },
    {
      "type": "View", "id": "detail_panel",
      "visibility": "gone",
      "weight": 2,
      "responsive": {
        "regular": { "visibility": "visible" }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Adaptive Spacing

```json
{
  "type": "View",
  "orientation": "vertical",
  "spacing": 8,
  "paddings": [16, 16, 16, 16],
  "responsive": {
    "regular": { "spacing": 24, "paddings": [24, 48, 24, 48] },
    "landscape": { "paddings": [16, 32, 16, 32] }
  }
}
```

### 3. Adaptive Font Size

```json
{
  "type": "Label",
  "text": "screen_title",
  "fontSize": 18,
  "responsive": {
    "regular": { "fontSize": 28 }
  }
}
```

### 4. Collection Column Count

```json
{
  "type": "Collection",
  "columnCount": 1,
  "responsive": {
    "regular": { "columnCount": 2 },
    "regular-landscape": { "columnCount": 3 }
  }
}
```

## Generated Code Behavior

### SwiftUI (Generated Mode)

- Responsive components are extracted to `@ViewBuilder` wrapper functions
- Container components use `@ViewBuilder content` closure to avoid child duplication
- `@Environment(\.horizontalSizeClass)` and `@Environment(\.verticalSizeClass)` are auto-added

### SwiftUI (Dynamic Mode)

- JSON tree is resolved at the dictionary level before component decoding
- Size class changes trigger automatic SwiftUI re-evaluation

### Compose (Generated Mode)

- Responsive components become `@Composable` wrapper functions with `content` lambda
- `WindowSizeClass` and `LocalConfiguration` imports are auto-added

### Compose (Dynamic Mode)

- JSON tree is resolved via `ResponsiveResolver` before component routing
- Configuration changes trigger automatic recomposition

### React/Tailwind

- Tailwind responsive prefixes (`md:`, `lg:`) are used
- Landscape handled via `useMediaQuery` hook

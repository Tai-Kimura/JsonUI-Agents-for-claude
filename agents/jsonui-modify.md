# JsonUI Modify Agent

## CRITICAL: This Agent Does NOT Do Work

**This agent ONLY manages modification workflow. It does NOT do any actual work.**

**ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN:**
- Do NOT create or edit JSON layout files directly - use `/jsonui-layout` skill
- Do NOT create or edit ViewModel files directly - use `/jsonui-viewmodel` skill
- Do NOT create or edit specification files directly - use `/jsonui-screen-spec` skill
- Do NOT create or edit test files directly - use test skills
- Do NOT write ANY files whatsoever
- ONLY tell the user which skill or agent to invoke

**If you catch yourself about to write or edit a file, STOP IMMEDIATELY and invoke the appropriate skill instead.**

---

## CRITICAL: One Screen at a Time

**When a modification affects multiple screens, you MUST complete ALL steps for EACH screen before moving to the next.**

**ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN:**
- Do NOT modify multiple screens in parallel
- Do NOT skip verification steps (build, spec-review)
- Do NOT skip test updates
- Do NOT consider a screen modification "done" until tests are updated

---

## CRITICAL: Read Before Modify

**Before making ANY modification, you MUST read the existing implementation to understand the current state.**

**For EACH screen being modified, read:**
1. Specification: `docs/screens/json/{screen_name}.spec.json`
2. Layout JSON: `Layouts/{ScreenName}.json` (and any includes/styles)
3. ViewModel: `ViewModel/{ScreenName}/{ScreenName}ViewModel.swift|kt|tsx`
4. Data section in layout JSON
5. Existing tests: `tests/screens/{screen_name}/{screen_name}.test.json`

**NEVER make modifications without understanding the current code.**

---

## CRITICAL: Mandatory First Response

**Your FIRST response MUST:**

1. Confirm the `{tools_directory}` - check if CLI tools are already installed:

```bash
ls {tools_directory}/jsonui-cli/ 2>/dev/null
```

2. If NOT found, install:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tai-Kimura/jsonui-cli/main/installer/bootstrap.sh | bash -s -- -d {tools_directory}
```

3. Ask what modification is needed:

```
What modification do you need?

A. **Add new screen** - Add a new screen to the existing project
B. **Modify existing screen** - Change UI, layout, or behavior of an existing screen
C. **Fix a bug** - Fix an issue in layout, data, or ViewModel
D. **API change** - Backend API changed, need to update the app
E. **Spec change** - Specification changed, propagate to implementation

Which type? (or describe your change and I'll determine the type)
```

Store the answer as `{modification_type}`.

## Rule References

Read the following rule files first:
- `rules/design-philosophy.md` - Core design principles
- `rules/skill-workflow.md` - Skill execution order and switching rules
- `rules/file-locations.md` - File placement rules

---

## Workflow by Modification Type

### Type A: Add New Screen

**Workflow: Spec → Component Check → Implement → Test**

#### Step A1: Create Screen Specification

Invoke `/jsonui-screen-spec` skill to create the new screen's specification.

Pass to skill:
- `tools_directory`: Path to tools
- `project_directory`: Project root path
- `skill_directory`: Path to skill examples

After spec creation, validate:
```bash
jsonui-doc validate spec docs/screens/json/{screen_name}.spec.json
```

Generate HTML:
```bash
jsonui-doc generate spec docs/screens/json/{screen_name}.spec.json -o docs/screens/html/{screen_name}.html
```

#### Step A2: Check Custom Components

Invoke `/jsonui-component-spec` skill to check if any custom components are needed.

**NEVER skip this step.**

#### Step A3: Implement Screen

Follow the same implementation flow as `jsonui-screen-impl`:

1. `/jsonui-generator` - Generate view files
2. `/jsonui-layout` - Implement layout JSON
3. `/jsonui-refactor` - Extract styles and includes
4. `/jsonui-data` - Define data properties
5. **Build and verify (ZERO warnings)**
6. `/jsonui-viewmodel` - Implement ViewModel (**MANDATORY**)
7. `/jsonui-spec-review` - Compare implementation with spec
8. `/jsonui-screen-spec` - Update spec if needed

#### Step A4: Create Tests

1. `/jsonui-screen-test-implement` - Create screen tests
2. `/jsonui-flow-test-implement` - Create flow tests (if the new screen is part of an existing flow)
3. `/jsonui-test-cli` - Validate all tests
4. `/jsonui-test-document` - Create test documentation

---

### Type B: Modify Existing Screen (UI Changes)

**Workflow: Read Current → Update Spec → Modify Implementation → Test**

#### Step B1: Read Current Implementation

Read ALL existing files for the screen:
- Specification (`.spec.json`)
- Layout JSON
- ViewModel
- Data section
- Existing tests

Report the current state to the user and confirm the changes needed.

#### Step B2: Update Specification

Invoke `/jsonui-screen-spec` skill to update the specification with the changes.

Validate and regenerate HTML after update.

#### Step B3: Modify Layout (if needed)

Invoke `/jsonui-layout` skill to modify the layout JSON.

Pass to skill:
- `tools_directory`: Path to tools
- `specification`: Updated spec path
- **Existing layout path** - The skill must READ the existing layout first

#### Step B4: Refactor (if needed)

Invoke `/jsonui-refactor` skill if styles or includes need updating.

#### Step B5: Update Data (if needed)

Invoke `/jsonui-data` skill if data properties changed (new bindings, type changes).

#### Step B6: Build and Verify

```bash
<tools_directory>/bin/<cli> build
```

**ZERO warnings required** before proceeding.

#### Step B7: Update ViewModel (if needed)

Invoke `/jsonui-viewmodel` skill if event handlers or business logic changed.

#### Step B8: Spec Review

Invoke `/jsonui-spec-review` skill to verify implementation matches updated spec.

If differences found, invoke `/jsonui-screen-spec` to reconcile.

#### Step B9: Update Tests

1. `/jsonui-screen-test-implement` - Update screen tests to reflect changes
2. `/jsonui-test-cli` - Validate tests
3. `/jsonui-test-document` - Update documentation

---

### Type C: Bug Fix

**Workflow: Investigate → Fix → Verify → Test**

#### Step C1: Investigate

Read the affected files and identify the root cause:
- Is it a layout issue? (wrong component, missing binding, incorrect attributes)
- Is it a data issue? (wrong type, missing property, incorrect callback)
- Is it a ViewModel issue? (logic error, API call issue, state management)

Report findings to the user and confirm the fix approach.

#### Step C2: Fix

Invoke the appropriate skill based on the root cause:

| Issue Type | Skill |
|------------|-------|
| Layout/UI issue | `/jsonui-layout` |
| Style issue | `/jsonui-refactor` |
| Data binding issue | `/jsonui-data` |
| ViewModel/logic issue | `/jsonui-viewmodel` |
| Multiple areas | Fix each with the appropriate skill, in order: layout → data → build → viewmodel |

#### Step C3: Build and Verify

```bash
<tools_directory>/bin/<cli> build
```

**ZERO warnings required.**

#### Step C4: Update Tests (if needed)

If the bug fix changed observable behavior:
1. `/jsonui-screen-test-implement` - Update affected test cases
2. `/jsonui-test-cli` - Validate tests

---

### Type D: API Change

**Workflow: Update API Spec → Identify Affected Screens → Update Each Screen → Test**

#### Step D1: Update API Specification

Invoke `/jsonui-swagger` skill to update the API specification.

#### Step D2: Identify Affected Screens

Search for screens that use the changed API endpoint:

```bash
grep -r "endpoint_name" docs/screens/json/*.spec.json
```

Read the `dataFlow.apiEndpoints` section of each affected spec.

Report the list of affected screens to the user.

#### Step D3: Update Each Affected Screen (One at a Time)

For each affected screen:

1. `/jsonui-screen-spec` - Update spec (dataFlow section)
2. `/jsonui-data` - Update data properties if response shape changed
3. **Build and verify**
4. `/jsonui-viewmodel` - Update API call logic
5. `/jsonui-spec-review` - Verify changes
6. Update tests

**Complete ALL steps for one screen before moving to the next.**

---

### Type E: Spec Change

**Workflow: Update Spec → Diff Against Implementation → Apply Changes → Test**

#### Step E1: Update Specification

Invoke `/jsonui-screen-spec` skill to make the spec changes.

Validate and regenerate HTML.

#### Step E2: Diff Against Implementation

Invoke `/jsonui-spec-review` skill to compare updated spec with current implementation.

The review will report:
- Added/removed/changed components
- Added/removed/changed data properties
- Added/removed/changed event handlers
- Layout hierarchy differences

#### Step E3: Apply Changes

Based on the diff report, apply changes following Type B workflow (Steps B3-B8).

#### Step E4: Update Tests

Follow Type B Step B9 for test updates.

---

## Non-JsonUI Framework Projects

**If the project uses a non-JsonUI framework** (Flutter, native SwiftUI, Jetpack Compose):

Before creating or updating screen specifications, check if `.jsonui-doc-rules.json` exists:

```bash
ls .jsonui-doc-rules.json 2>/dev/null
```

If NOT found, invoke `/jsonui-doc-rules` skill to set up custom validation rules:
1. `jsonui-doc rules init --flutter` (for Flutter) or `jsonui-doc rules init` (for others)
2. Edit the config to add framework-specific rules
3. Verify with `jsonui-doc rules show`

**This prevents validation errors on framework-specific components and event handlers.**

## Important Rules

- **Delegate, don't do** - This agent only manages workflow, never does actual work
- **Read before modify** - ALWAYS read existing code before making changes
- **One screen at a time** - Complete all steps for each screen before moving on
- **Build verification** - ZERO warnings after every modification
- **Test updates required** - Update tests after every implementation change
- **Spec-driven** - Specification is the single source of truth; update it first, then implementation
- **Always pass tools_directory** - Skills need this to find attribute definitions
- **If unsure, invoke the skill** - Let the skill make the decision, not you

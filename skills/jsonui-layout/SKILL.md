# JsonUI Layout Agent

Specialized in correct JSON layout implementation. Styles extraction and DRY cleanup are done inline — there is no separate refactor skill.

## `role` — declaring what a layout IS

A layout root may declare `"role": "screen" | "cell" | "partial"`. It decides
whether the layout is a navigation destination (and so carries a screen marker
and may appear as a test's `screen`) or a fragment that renders inside a host.

When it is absent the role is DERIVED: a layout referenced by another via
`cell` / `header` / `footer` / `cellClasses` / `include` is a fragment,
`"partial": true` is a fragment, and anything left over is a screen. The
derivation is deliberately imperfect — a fragment that nothing references yet
derives to "screen". `jui build` reports this, and the fix is to declare the
role explicitly, never to rename the file.

Declare `"role"` explicitly whenever a layout's purpose is not obvious from how
it is referenced.

## Rule Reference

Read the following rule files first:
- `rules/file-locations.md` - File placement rules

## Input Parameters

Received from parent agent:
- `<tools_directory>`: Path to tools directory (e.g., `/path/to/project/sjui_tools`)
- `<specification>`: Path to screen specification JSON (e.g., `docs/screens/json/login.spec.json`)
- `<layouts_directory>`: Path to shared Layout JSON directory (e.g., `docs/screens/layouts`)
- `<source_project_path>` (optional): Path to existing project on another platform
- `<source_platform>` (optional): The source platform (iOS / Android / Web)

## Where to Edit Layout JSON

**All Layout JSON MUST be edited in the shared `layouts_directory`**, NOT in platform-specific directories.

```
# ❌ WRONG - editing platform copy (will be overwritten by jui build)
vim my-app-ios/my-app/Layouts/login.json

# ✅ CORRECT - editing shared source
vim docs/screens/layouts/login.json
jui build  # distributes to all platforms
```

## Cross-Platform Copy (REQUIRED when source_project_path is provided)

**When `<source_project_path>` is provided, you MUST copy from the existing platform FIRST before making any edits.**

JsonUI layouts are cross-platform — the same JSON works on iOS, Android, and Web.

### Procedure:
1. Find the corresponding layout JSON in the source project:
   - Look in `<source_project_path>/Layouts/` for the screen JSON file
   - Also check for includes, styles, and string resources
2. **Copy the layout JSON as-is** to the shared `layouts_directory`
3. **Copy related includes, styles, and resources** to the shared directory
4. After copying, review the layout and adjust only if necessary

**Do NOT rewrite layouts from scratch when a source exists. Always copy first.**

---

## Reading Specification (REQUIRED)

Before implementing layouts, read the specification JSON and extract:
- `structure.components` - Component list with IDs, types, descriptions, optional `children`, `style`, `binding`
- `structure.layout` - Layout hierarchy (parent-child relationships, `overlay` for ZStack-style stacking)
- `structure.decorativeElements` - Decorative elements with `parentId` for insertion
- `structure.wrapperViews` - Wrapper views with `targetId`
- `stateManagement.uiVariables` - Data bindings to use (`@{variableName}`)
- `stateManagement.eventHandlers` - Event bindings to use (`@{onHandlerName}`)
- `stateManagement.displayLogic` - Visibility rules (may include explicit `variableName`). A node that an `element` or a state's `visibleElements` names takes that id exactly as the spec writes it — except inside an include that has an id, where the spec names the resolved id (`hero` + `type_badge` → `heroTypeBadge`) and the node in the included layout keeps its own (`type_badge`). When the node already exists under another spelling, the spec is what gets corrected — do not rename the node.

## Creating new sub-files

A new sub-file (partial, collection cell) referenced from a Layout JSON is a Layout JSON you write by hand in the shared layouts directory, at the path the reference names: jui has no command that generates one (`jui g partial` / `jui g collection` do not exist). A layout that nothing references yet reads as a screen with no spec in `jui verify` — add the reference in the same change, or put `"partial": true` on its root.

This skill only handles editing existing JSON layouts.

---

## Required: Attribute Validation

Before creating/editing layouts:
1. If `lookup_component` / `lookup_attribute` MCP tools are available, use them to look up component specs
2. Otherwise, read `<tools_directory>/lib/core/attribute_definitions.json`
3. Check constraints in the `description` field
4. Check required attributes in the `required` field

**Never guess attribute names or types. Always verify against definitions.**

## Post-Build Validation (Required)

After creating/editing layouts:
1. Run `jui build` (distributes layouts from shared directory to all platforms + builds)
2. Review all warnings
3. Complete when warnings are zero

**Note:** Do NOT run platform-specific build tools directly for layout validation — use `jui build` to ensure layouts are properly distributed first.

---

## Screen Root Structure

Rules for full-screen layouts (not include/cell):

1. **Root must be SafeAreaView**
2. **Do not specify orientation on SafeAreaView**
3. **Second level must be ScrollView or Collection**

→ Examples: `examples/screen-root-structure.json`, `examples/screen-root-wrong.json`

**SafeAreaView/ScrollView not needed for includes or cells**

---

## Collection Implementation

Set `CollectionDataSource` type via binding on the `items` attribute.

### UIKit / Android Views (Dynamic mode)

→ Example: `examples/collection-uikit.json`

No `sections` needed. Cell configuration is controlled by `CollectionDataSource`.

### SwiftUI / Jetpack Compose (Generated mode)

→ Examples: `examples/collection-swiftui-basic.json`, `examples/collection-swiftui-full.json`

Define cell/header/footer structure via `sections`. Each view requires a JSON file.

### REQUIRED: cellIdProperty

**Every Collection MUST have `cellIdProperty` set.** This ensures each cell has a unique identity for efficient diffing and animation.

```json
{
  "type": "Collection",
  "cellIdProperty": "id",
  "items": "@{productItems}",
  "sections": [{ "cell": "item_cell" }]
}
```

- `cellIdProperty` specifies which field in the cell data uniquely identifies each item (typically `"id"`)
- ViewModel must ensure each item in the data source has a unique value for this field
- Without this, SwiftUI/Compose cannot properly animate list changes or maintain scroll position

### Wrong Example

→ Example: `examples/collection-wrong.json` - Manual view repetition prohibited

---

## TabView (Tab Navigation)

**⛔ NEVER create custom tab bars manually. Always use the built-in TabView component.**

TabView provides native tab navigation with:
- Platform-native tab bar appearance
- Automatic icon and title rendering
- Proper view switching

→ Examples: `examples/tabview.json`, `examples/tabview-wrong.json`

### ⛔ CRITICAL: TabView Structure

**TabView is the ROOT of the app, NOT a child inside a screen.**

Each tab's `view` attribute references a SEPARATE JSON file. The tab content is NOT defined inline.

**CORRECT Structure:**
```
root.json (TabView only)
├── home.json (Home screen content)
├── search.json (Search screen content)
└── profile.json (Profile screen content)
```

**TabView JSON (root.json):**
```json
{
  "type": "TabView",
  "tabs": [
    { "title": "Home", "icon": "house", "view": "home" },
    { "title": "Search", "icon": "magnifyingglass", "view": "search" },
    { "title": "Profile", "icon": "person", "view": "profile" }
  ]
}
```

**Tab Content JSON (home.json):**
```json
{
  "type": "SafeAreaView",
  "child": {
    "type": "ScrollView",
    "child": {
      "_comment": "Home screen content here"
    }
  }
}
```

### Prohibited Patterns

**DO NOT:**
- Put TabView inside SafeAreaView or ScrollView
- Put TabView as a child of another view
- Define tab content inline inside TabView
- Create a View with horizontal buttons as a tab bar
- Manually implement tab switching logic in ViewModel
- Use onClick handlers to switch between tabs

**WRONG - TabView inside screen content:**
```json
{
  "type": "SafeAreaView",
  "child": [
    { "type": "ScrollView", "child": { "...content..." } },
    { "type": "TabView", "tabs": [...] }
  ]
}
```

**If you need tab-based navigation, TabView is the ROOT. Period.**

---

## Embed (Cross-Screen Embedding)

Use `Embed` when a screen hosts another screen as a region of its layout (tablet master/detail, dashboard panels). **The embedded screen owns its own ViewModel** — completely independent from the parent VM. This is the core design contract; it is what separates `Embed` from `include` (which shares the parent VM) and `TabView` (which also shares).

### When to use Embed

- iPad master/detail: master list on the left, embed `OrderDetail` on the right
- Dashboards: a dashboard screen hosting `RecentActivity`, `Calendar`, etc.
- Same screen reused: phone shows it standalone, tablet embeds it inside a parent

### Layout JSON shape

```json
{
  "type": "View",
  "id": "rootContainer",
  "orientation": "horizontal",
  "child": [
    {
      "type": "View",
      "id": "masterPane",
      "width": 320,
      "child": [ /* master list */ ]
    },
    {
      "type": "Embed",
      "id": "detailPane",
      "screen": "order_detail",
      "params": { "orderId": "@{selectedOrderId}" },
      "navigationMode": "delegate",
      "weight": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

### Attribute conventions

| Attribute | Convention | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | **camelCase**, unique within the parent layout | Doubles as the Android `ViewModelStoreOwner` key — must be unique even when the same screen is embedded twice. |
| `screen` | **snake_case layout JSON filename** (no extension) | E.g. `order_detail` loads `docs/screens/layouts/order_detail.json`. Codegen converts to PascalCase View class name. |
| `params` | keys camelCase | Values: literal or `@{varName}` binding against the parent VM. Embedded VMs that implement `applyInitParams(_:)` consume them; others ignore. |
| `navigationMode` | `"delegate"` (default) or `"isolated"` | delegate forwards `navigate()` to the parent's NavController/Router; isolated gives the embed a private stack, and `jui build` refuses it when the embedded screen's spec declares a present-type transition. |

### Rules

- **Same screen multi-embed** is supported. Each Layout JSON `Embed.id` keys a separate VM instance. ID uniqueness is critical on Android.
- **Embedded screen needs no changes** — its spec and layout stay as-is. The parent declares the embedding.
- **Navigation bounded at the embed**: `pop` / `dismiss` / `navigateBack` from inside the embedded screen do NOT close the embed itself (runtime enforces this in delegate mode).
- **No localize on the Embed node** — the node has no user-visible strings. The embedded screen is localized as part of its own implementation.
- **Spec contract**: when adding an Embed to a Layout JSON, the parent spec must also declare `structure.embeds[]` with a matching `regionId` (camelCase same as the layout `id`), or `jui verify` will flag drift.

→ Examples: `examples/embed.json` (parent layout), `examples/embed-spec-fragment.json` (spec side).

See also `rules/specification-rules.md` (5) Section and `rules/design-philosophy.md` "VM isolation across embedded screens".

---

## Include Syntax

**Include is NOT a type** - It's a reference directive.

Creation commands:
```bash
<tools_directory>/bin/<cli> g partial header
<tools_directory>/bin/<cli> g partial popups/confirm
```

→ Examples: `examples/include-correct.json`, `examples/include-wrong.json`

**An included layout reads the including screen's data** — an include is an
inline expansion, and the screen's ViewModel owns that data. With an `id` on
the include node, the included layout's ids and data names take the id as a
prefix, camelCase-joined: in an include with id `side`, the included layout's
`@{title}` reads the screen's `sideTitle`; without an `id` it reads `title`.
A nested include is expanded too, and its id is joined to the prefix above it
(`row` → `chip_a` → `rowChipA…`). An include without an `id` is a defined
form, not a mistake: from jsonui-cli 1.9.6 sjui no longer warns `is missing
'id'` for it. The include node's object maps are laid over that data for the
included layout — `shared_data`, then `data` (`data` wins on a key both set):
a key is a name the included layout binds, a value is a literal or a binding
read in the including layout's scope
(`{ "include": "card", "data": { "title": "@{headline}" } }`). This holds on
every platform from jsonui-cli 1.9.6 (Dynamic mode from SwiftJsonUI 10.29.2 /
KotlinJsonUI 2.43.2); before it, web handed an included layout none of the
screen's data (it drew its own defaults), and the iOS and Android generated
code ignored an object map.

One name declared twice in the expanded screen — say the screen and an
include without an `id` both declare `title` — is one data entry: with one
type that is fine; with two types the Data type keeps the first, and from
jsonui-cli 1.9.6 every platform warns `data property '<name>' is declared as
'<A>' and as '<B>'` (before, iOS and Android dropped the second silently, and
web wrote both and did not compile). Declare it once, or give the include an
`id` so the names are two.

---

## Data Binding

### Syntax

- Bind with `@{}`: `"text": "@{title}"`, `"onClick": "@{onButtonTap}"`
- **A bound value is one binding.** Text around a binding (`"Title: @{x}"`,
  `"@{a} / @{b}"`, `"https://cdn/@{id}.png"`) composes a string in the layout:
  compose it in the ViewModel and bind it as one value (`"@{titleLine}"`) —
  a layout holds no logic, and a string composed in the layout cannot be
  localized as one text. From jsonui-cli 1.9.6 the build warns
  `[binding-mixed-text] '<Type>.<attr>' mixes literal text with a binding …`
  on an attribute the component declares (before, iOS and web joined the
  pieces and Android drew the first binding alone)
- **Handler names**: write an event as `"@{onTap}"`. An event that takes
  only a binding (`onClick`, `onLongPress`, `onPan`, a Switch / Slider /
  Segment / CheckBox / Radio / SelectBox `onValueChange`, …) calls nothing
  for a bare `"onTap"`, and from jsonui-cli 1.9.6 the build warns `… is the
  bare name 'onTap', but the attribute is declared binding-only: write
  '@{onTap}' … (binding-bare-event)`. On an event whose declared type
  includes a string (`onTextChange`, `onItemAppear`, a Collection's or
  TabView's `onValueChange` and its aliases `onPageChanged` /
  `onValueChanged` / `onTabChange`) a bare name is called, the same as
  `@{onTap}`, from jsonui-cli 1.9.6 (Dynamic mode: SwiftJsonUI 10.29.2 /
  KotlinJsonUI 2.43.2); before, several of them dropped it without a word.
  On Android generated code a bare `onTextChange` passes the text to a
  handler that takes it from jsonui-cli 1.9.7 (in 1.9.6 it compiled only
  for a handler declared `() -> Void`).
  `lookup_attribute` shows each event's type
- **Views with bindings must have an `id`**
- **Never prefix with `data.`** — bindings reference variables by bare name regardless of where they're declared (`data: [...]` at the root of a cell Layout, `stateManagement.uiVariables` in the spec, `dataFlow.viewModel.vars` — all resolve the same way at the binding site)

**Wrong:** `"@{data.titleKey}"`, `"@{data.onNavigate}"`
**Right:** `"@{titleKey}"`, `"@{onNavigate}"`

The `data: [...]` block in a Collection cell Layout only DECLARES the variable names + types; it is not a namespace. Downstream generators (sjui / kjui / rjui) emit direct property access from the bare names — a `data.` prefix becomes a broken path at runtime.

### This Skill Does Not Define the Data Section

Only write `@{bindingName}`. Type definitions live in the spec's `stateManagement.uiVariables` and `dataFlow.viewModel.vars` — see the `jsonui-dataflow` skill.

### Canonical Expression Forms (SwiftJsonUI ≥ 10.6.0 / KotlinJsonUI ≥ 2.13.0)

The resolution semantics are SSoT-declared (`shared/core/binding_semantics.json`;
`get_binding_rules` returns them under `semantics`). Canonical forms:

- **Dot path / bracket index** (read-only value + text contexts, all platforms):
  `@{profile.name}`, `@{items[0].title}`
- **Default**: `@{title ?? "Untitled"}` or `?? 'Untitled'` — ONE `??` max;
  string defaults in single or double quotes, `true`/`false`/number bare.
  A resolved value (even `false`/`0`/`""`) always wins over the default.
- **Negation**: `@{!isHidden}` — **boolean value attributes only**
  (`hidden`, `enabled`, ...). Anywhere else it is a validator error.
- **Two-way bindings** (TextField text, Switch isOn, ...) must be a single
  flat identifier — no dots, brackets, `??`, or `!`.
- **A control's value written without a binding** (`"isOn": true`,
  `"selectedIndex": 1`, a Slider's `"value": 0.3`) is where the control
  starts: the user changes it, and the view model does not hold it. Bind it
  (`"isOn": "@{notifyOn}"`) when the view model must read or set it; add
  `enabled: false` when the user must not change it. In the SwiftUI, Compose and web code `jui build` generates this
  holds from jsonui-cli 1.9.0 — before, on Android a static Switch, CheckBox,
  Radio, Segment, Slider or SelectBox did not move when tapped, and on web a
  Radio's static `selectedValue`, a Segment, a TabView and a date SelectBox
  did not. A Slider with no `value` starts at its minimum; on web, one with no
  `step` (a web-only attribute) moves continuously — before 1.9.0 the web slider moved in whole steps, so
  over the default range 0 … 1 it had two positions: one with no `value`
  started at 1, and a `"value": 0.3` was drawn at 0.
- Unresolved keys: text renders empty, typed values fall back to the
  attribute default, Embed params drop the key (child defaults apply).

### No Logic in Bindings (Critical)

**Prohibited patterns:**
- `@{selectedTab == 0 ? #D4A574 : #B8A894}` - Ternary operators
- `@{items.count > 0}` - Comparisons
- `@{price * quantity}` - Calculations
- `"Total: @{count}"` - Text around a binding (`binding-mixed-text`, 1.9.6+): bind a `totalLine` the ViewModel composes

**Allowed:**
- `@{searchTabColor}` - ViewModel computed property
- `@{onButtonTap}` - ViewModel function
- `@{!isHidden}` - Negation, on boolean value attributes only

→ Examples: `examples/binding-correct.json`, `examples/binding-wrong.json`

### ID Naming Convention (Required)

Use component type as suffix:

| Component | Suffix | Example |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Label | `Label` | `titleLabel` |
| TextField | `TextField` | `emailTextField` |
| Button | `Button` | `submitButton` |
| Image | `Image` | `profileImage` |
| CheckBox | `CheckBox` | `agreeCheckBox` |
| Switch | `Switch` | `notificationSwitch` |

→ Examples: `examples/id-naming-correct.json`, `examples/id-naming-wrong.json`

### Images: `alt` is what screen readers say (1.9.0+)

`alt` on Image, CircleImage and NetworkImage is the text VoiceOver, TalkBack
and the web read for the image, in SwiftUI, Compose and web layouts (UIKit
and Android Views layouts do not read it):

- `"alt": "photo_label"` — a strings.json key (or text), localized like `text`
- `"alt": "@{photoTitle}"` — a binding; `""` at runtime makes the image decorative
- `"alt": ""` — decorative, on purpose

With no `alt` an image is decorative (screen readers skip it), unless it
operates something: a tap of its own (*Tappables are announced as buttons*,
below, says what is one) or an `onLongPress` that names a method (not with `enabled: false`, and not
inside `userInteractionEnabled: false`), or it is the only thing naming the nearest element around
it that operates something, long press included (no text, no other image
with an `alt`).
Such an image keeps reading what it read before (its id or asset name, a
fixed word, or nothing — an Android Image with no id, and any web image),
and the iOS and Android builds name it (web does not):
`[info] <layout>.json: <Type> '<id>' operates a control and has no alt, …`.
Give it an `alt` that says what the control does.

Nothing can tell a meaningful image from decoration, so decide for each one: a
logo, a product or profile photo, and an icon that is a button's only content
(close, send, menu) need an `alt`; an icon beside text that already says it, a
divider and a background do not.

Write `alt`: `accessibilityLabel` and `contentDescription` are read as aliases,
and `jui build` rewrites them to `alt` in the layouts it distributes (your
layout file keeps its spelling). The SwiftUI / Compose Dynamic mode (hot
reload) reads all three spellings from SwiftJsonUI 10.29.0
/ KotlinJsonUI 2.42.0. Before jsonui-cli 1.9.0, `alt` was
read on web only; iOS and Android read an internal name (the asset name, the
id, or a fixed English word) or, for an Android Image with no id, nothing,
except that Android read a `contentDescription` the layout wrote.

### Tappables are announced as buttons (1.9.0+)

In SwiftUI and Compose layouts (UIKit and Android Views layouts are outside
this), an element whose `onClick` or `onclick` names a method, and that is
not a control itself, is announced as a button on iOS, and on Android when it
has no children, unless it holds something a user can operate on its own —
how depends on what it holds:

- with no children (an Image, a Label), it is the button, on iOS and Android;
- with children, none of which a user can operate on its own, on iOS it
  becomes one button whose name is its content — so it needs a text, or an
  image with an `alt` (above), inside it. When nothing else inside names it,
  an image with no `alt` keeps reading what it read before (its id or asset
  name, a fixed word, or nothing), and the iOS and Android builds name it
  (INFO). On Android
  the container gets the button role, but Compose reports the Button class
  only for a node without children, so it keeps the class of a plain view;
- when it holds something a user can operate on its own, it is left as it
  was and is not announced as a button. That is: a type declared
  `interactive: true` in component_metadata.json (TextField, Switch,
  Collection, ScrollView, Web, …), a type the declaration does not know (a
  custom component), a descendant that is a tap itself or has an
  `onLongPress` that names a method (not with `enabled: false`), or a Label
  with links (`linkable`, or a
  `partialAttributes` range with `onClick` / `onclick`). A screen-reader
  user can still reach what is inside, but is not told the container is a
  button.

A project's own component counts as a control itself, so a custom
component with `onClick` is never announced as a button, with or without
children. JsonUI does not know what a project's component holds, and a button or a
combined element could hide a control inside it from screen readers — so
the component gives itself its role, in its own code: in its SwiftUI view
`.accessibilityAddTraits(.isButton)`, in its composable
`Modifier.semantics { role = Role.Button }`.

What is not a tap:

- A handler that names no method — `""`, spaces only, `"@{}"`, `[]`,
  `[""]`. Nothing is generated for it, and `jui build` warns `Attribute
  '<path>' in '<Type>' names no handler (…) — no tap is generated for it.
  Name the method, or remove the attribute`; a blank element of an
  `onclick` array is skipped with `… has a blank handler at [<i>] — it names
  no method and is not called`. Earlier releases generated code for most of
  these that did not compile (`[]` gave a tap that called nothing). Name the
  method, or leave the attribute out until the method exists.
- A tap written shut: `enabled: false`, `canTap: false`, or
  `userInteractionEnabled: false` on it or on a node around it — inside such
  a node nothing counts as operated, a long press included. `canTap` is a
  gate, not a handler — `false` (or a binding that resolves false) turns
  `onClick` / `onclick` off, and with no `canTap` the handler alone makes
  the tap, so never add `canTap: true` to make one. A container whose only
  handler is `onLongPress`, or that has `canTap` and no handler, is not a
  tap either. (In UIKit layouts `canTap` sets only the pressed state.)
  A Button is a control, not a tap: under `enabled: false` it is a dimmed
  button, and under `canTap: false` a button whose action does nothing. So
  is an IconLabel with a handler on iOS, where it is drawn as a native
  button.
- An `onClick` / `onclick` on a text field (TextField, TextView, EditText or
  Input). A text field's
  tap focuses it; from jsonui-cli 1.9.0 `jui build`
  warns `onClick on a TextField is not called: a text field's tap focuses
  it` (`… on a TextView …`) once for each such node. Remove the handler — bind `text` to read what the user types;
  `onTextChange` is called on each change.
- An `onClick` / `onclick` on a Web: the embedded page takes the taps. Nor
  is an `onPan` on a TextField, a TextView or a Slider called — the
  control's own drag (text selection, the slider's value) takes the
  gesture. From jsonui-cli 1.9.6 `jui build` warns `'<attr>' is not called
  on a <Type>: <reason>` on every platform, and Android no longer wires a
  TextView's `onPan`. Remove the attribute.

A control's own `onClick` — on a Switch, Toggle, CheckBox, Radio, Segment,
Slider or SelectBox — is called once, after the control's own change (a Slider's when the drag
ends), in the SwiftUI, Compose and web code `jui build` generates from
jsonui-cli 1.9.0: `canTap: false` stops the call and not the change, and
`enabled: false` stops both. Dynamic mode (hot reload) ships with
SwiftJsonUI and KotlinJsonUI, not with jsonui-cli. To act on a control's change,
bind its value (the view model's var then changes with it) rather than
reading it in `onClick`.

A pager's (a paging Collection's) `onValueChange` / `onPageChanged` is
called with the new page when the page changes — a swipe, a `scrollTo`, a
`currentPage` write — and not when the pager first appears. A TabView's
`onValueChange` is called with the new index when the selected tab changes —
a tap on another tab, a `selectedIndex` write — not when the TabView first
appears, and not when the selected tab is tapped again. Both hold on every
platform from jsonui-cli 1.9.6 (Dynamic mode: SwiftJsonUI 10.29.2 /
KotlinJsonUI 2.43.2); before, Android called the pager's handler with the
page it appeared on (web, with that page on the first scroll), and Android
and web called the TabView's on every tab tap and never on a `selectedIndex`
write. Load what the first page or tab shows when
the screen loads, not from this handler.

A tap whose `enabled` is bound stays a button, and reads as disabled while
the value is false, on iOS and Android. A bound `canTap` or `userInteractionEnabled` also stops the tap while it is false, and the element is not announced as a button then (a
Button, and an IconLabel on iOS, stay a button that does nothing), but
nothing marks it disabled — so to switch a tap off at run time and have it
read as disabled, bind `enabled`.

Each id inside a tappable is found once, by its own id, on iOS and Android,
so a test finds a Label inside a tappable by its own id. A tappable with an
id carries it too, so a test finds the container by its id; one with no id
cannot be found as a whole (on iOS its button's identifier is empty) —
reach it through an id inside it, and give a tappable with nothing inside
(an Image, a Label) an id of its own. This holds for a project's own
container components too, once their converter is scaffolded by
1.9.0 or later (on iOS, regenerate an older one as it was
made, with `--force` added — `jui g converter --from <spec> --force` — which
discards hand edits). The SwiftUI / Compose Dynamic mode (hot reload) does
the same from SwiftJsonUI 10.29.0 / KotlinJsonUI
2.42.0, except that on iOS, while a bound `canTap` is
false, a container is not combined into one element.

On web, from jsonui-cli 1.9.0, the same rule gives a tap it makes a button —
or one element — `role="button"`, a tab stop (`tabIndex={0}`) and Enter /
Space that click it; a bound `canTap` or `enabled` gates all three, and a
control, a project's own component, a tap holding a control and a tap inside
a stop are left as they are. What `userInteractionEnabled: false` (or a
binding while it is false) stops is `inert` there: out of reach of the
pointer, the keyboard and screen readers, and drawn the same. Before
1.9.0, a web Label or View with `onClick` was reached by neither Tab nor a
screen reader's list of buttons, and `userInteractionEnabled: false` stopped
the pointer alone.

On web, from jsonui-cli 1.9.1, a tap inside another tap in the same
layout file stops the click there, as on iOS / Android; to let a click
through, declare the handler `(Event)` in the layout's data and decide in
the view model.

## String Resources

### strings.json Format

Structure: `{ "file_prefix": { "key": "value" } }`

→ Example: `examples/strings-json.json`

- `file_prefix`: Matches JSON layout filename (`login.json` → `"login"`)
- Reuse existing keys when available

### Text Extraction Rules

Extracted attributes: `text`, `hint`, `placeholder`, `label`, `prompt`, and `alt` from jsonui-cli 1.9.0

Not extracted when:
- Starts with `@{` (data binding)
- snake_case format (treated as key reference)
- 2 characters or less

---

## Color Resources

### Allowed Formats

1. Color names from colors.json: `"primary_color"`, `"deep_gray"`
2. Hex: `"#FF5500"`, `"#1A1410"`, `"#80FF5500"` (AARRGGBB format with alpha)

### Prohibited Formats

- `rgba(...)`, `rgb(...)`, `hsl(...)`
- `Color.red`, `UIColor.white`

→ Examples: `examples/color-correct.json`, `examples/color-wrong.json`

### `tintColor` is an accent, not a text colour

`tintColor` colours what is operated — a control's accent, a link, a text field's cursor (SwiftUI's `.tint`, CSS `accent-color`). Give text its colour with `fontColor`. In the Compose code kjui generates, text and icons that set no colour of their own inside a node with `tintColor` took the tint before jsonui-cli 1.9.0, and do not from 1.9.0 (KotlinJsonUI Dynamic never passed it on): where a layout relied on that, give them `fontColor`.

---

## partialAttributes

The `range` in `partialAttributes` supports two formats:

1. **Array** `[start, end]`: Index-based range
2. **String**: Text pattern matching

`onClick` makes a partial range tappable. The handler must be defined in the data section as `(() -> Void)?`.

→ Example: `examples/partial-attributes.json`

String format is preferred when the target text is static and readable.

---

## Border Limitations (SwiftUI / Compose)

`borderWidth` applies a border to **all four sides**. Direction-specific borders (`borderBottomWidth`, `borderTopWidth`, etc.) are supported in **UIKit / Android Views only**.

In SwiftUI / Compose generated code, create a separate View as a divider line instead.

→ Example: `examples/border-divider.json`

**Do NOT use `borderBottomWidth` / `borderTopWidth` in SwiftUI / Compose layouts.**

---

## Custom Components (Converter)

When generating Converters:
1. Scaffold it from its component spec: `jui g converter --from <name>.component.json` (the specification rules, *Custom Components — spec first*). Its prop types are the spec's `props.items[].type` (*Prop types* there); `lookup_attribute` describes the standard components, not these props
2. When a layout uses it, a prop it leaves out takes the scaffold's default, never the spec's `default`: the type's value on iOS and Android (`""`, 0, false, `[]` …; `nil` for `T?`), `undefined` on web — with a component scaffolded before jsonui-cli 1.9.0, a non-optional scalar left out fails the iOS build. A literal must be of the prop's spec type; a callback, a `CollectionDataSource` or an app type takes a binding (`@{…}`). Any other value is not passed, and the build that converts the layout warns `<Name>.<prop>: the layout's <value> is not a <type> literal this converter can write — …` — not again while the layout is cached, so read it from `jui build --clean` (the specification rules, *Prop types*).
3. Do not pass `--attributes` or `--container` by hand: `--from` / `--all` read the props and slots from the spec. The one thing declared by hand is a leaf, once, with `jui g converter <Name> --no-container`. Do not add it to a `--from` run, which does not read it (the specification rules, *Leaf components*). `--skip-existing` / `--force` only choose what happens to scaffold files that already exist
4. Give a custom component children only when its component spec lists
   slots (`slots.items` is non-empty). From jsonui-cli 1.9.0 a
   component declared a leaf (`--no-container`) fails the build when a
   layout gives it children, and a component in the default mode draws them
   without a word — see the specification rules, *Leaf components*
5. A layout's `onClick` on a custom component gives it no screen-reader role
   (*Tappables are announced as buttons*, above): the component gives itself
   its role in its own code (the specification rules, *A tap on a custom
   component*)
6. A literal String prop is localized (looked up as a strings.json key, as
   a Label's `text` is) only when the prop's name is display text — `text`,
   `hint`, `placeholder`, `label`, `prompt`, `alt`, `accessibilityLabel` —
   and written as the literal otherwise (`"variant": "bar"`), on iOS and
   Android alike, in a converter scaffolded by jsonui-cli 1.9.6 or later.
   Before, Android looked every String literal up (and could warn `Bare key
   … foreign section` for a `variant`) and iOS looked none up. A converter
   scaffolded earlier keeps its old behaviour until it is scaffolded again:
   the user runs the command on its header's `Generator:` line in a
   terminal and answers `y` only for the converter file
   (`<name>_converter.rb` for sjui, `<name>_component.rb` for kjui) and `n`
   for the rest (the Swift / Kotlin component holds the app's code). Never
   add `--force`, which overwrites the component's body too. Run from an
   agent's shell (not a terminal) the command keeps every file and asks
   nothing

## Responsive Layout

Components can have a `responsive` block for size class-based attribute overrides:

```json
{
  "type": "View",
  "orientation": "vertical",
  "spacing": 8,
  "responsive": {
    "regular": { "orientation": "horizontal", "spacing": 24 },
    "landscape": { "spacing": 16 },
    "regular-landscape": { "orientation": "horizontal", "spacing": 32 }
  },
  "child": [...]
}
```

### Size Class Keys

| Key | Description |
|---|---|
| `compact` | Small screen (iPhone, compact Android) |
| `medium` | Medium screen (Android medium) |
| `regular` | Large screen (iPad, Android expanded) |
| `landscape` | Landscape orientation |
| `compact-landscape` | Small screen + landscape |
| `regular-landscape` | Large screen + landscape |

Priority: compound > landscape > regular > medium > compact > default

### Rules

- `responsive` can be added to ANY component
- Only attribute overrides — `type`, `child`, `data` CANNOT be in responsive
- Unspecified attributes keep the default value
- Use for: orientation changes, spacing/padding adjustments, visibility toggling, fontSize changes
- For completely different structures, use variant files (`screen@regular.json`) — see below

### Common Patterns

**Vertical → Horizontal on tablet:**
```json
{ "orientation": "vertical", "responsive": { "regular": { "orientation": "horizontal" } } }
```

**Show sidebar on tablet:**
```json
{ "visibility": "gone", "responsive": { "regular": { "visibility": "visible" } } }
```

**Adaptive spacing:**
```json
{ "spacing": 8, "responsive": { "regular": { "spacing": 24 }, "landscape": { "spacing": 16 } } }
```

## Variant Files (whole-tree replacement per size class)

When a size class needs a **structurally different** layout (not just
attribute tweaks), ship a sibling variant file:

```
Layouts/home.json            ← base (REQUIRED, canonical)
Layouts/home@regular.json    ← full replacement for the regular tier
```

**Vocabulary (v1):** `@compact` / `@medium` / `@regular` only.
Landscape and combined forms stay in the inline `responsive` attribute.
`@tablet` is not a size class — use `@regular`.

**Resolution:** tier X renders `<base>@X.json` when it exists, otherwise
the base. No cross-tier promotion (a medium window with only `@regular`
shipped renders the base). Tier detection matches inline `responsive`:
iOS horizontal size class (no medium on iOS — `@medium` folds into the
compact tier, `@compact` wins when both exist), Android 600/840dp, web
768/1024px.

**Contract (enforced as `jui build` errors):**
- The variant is a FULL replacement — no partial merge (share structure
  via `include`/styles instead)
- Variants must NOT declare a `data` section — the data contract is
  base-canonical; every `@{binding}` in a variant must be declared in
  the base's `data` section
- Variants must NOT declare `platforms` (inherited from the base)
- Screen-root layouts only: no variants of `partial: true` layouts or
  Collection cell layouts
- A real layout named `<base>_<class>_variant.json` collides with the
  generated variant view name

**State contract:** a size-class change swaps the whole tree — VM-owned
state (bindings) survives (one VM instance spans the swap); view-local
state (scroll position, unbound input, focus) is lost by design. Any
input that must survive a Split View / foldable transition belongs in a
VM binding.

**Generated code:** the base screen's GeneratedView gains a size-class
dispatch and each variant gets its own `<Base><Class>VariantGeneratedView`
sharing the base's Data/ViewModel. Variants never generate their own
VM/Data/spec. Old dynamic runtimes ignore variant files and render the
base (graceful degradation).

## Platform-Specific Overrides

Use the `platform` key for attributes that differ between iOS, Android, and Web:

```json
{
  "type": "View",
  "id": "hero",
  "height": 200,
  "platform": {
    "ios": { "height": 220 },
    "android": { "height": 180 },
    "web": { "height": "100vh", "maxWidth": 1200 }
  }
}
```

**How it works:**
- `jui build` resolves `platform` overrides at build time
- Each platform gets its own values (iOS → `height: 220`, Android → `height: 180`)
- The `platform` key is removed from the distributed JSON
- Attributes not overridden keep the base value

**⚠️ `platform` vs `responsive`:**

| Key | Resolved | Purpose |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `platform` | `jui build` time (static) | iOS/Android/Web differences |
| `responsive` | App runtime (dynamic) | Screen size class switching |

Both can coexist on the same node.

**⚠️ Do NOT confuse with `"platform": "swift"`:**
The existing string value `"platform": "swift"` in data sections is a SwiftJsonUI platform filter — it is NOT an override map. Only dict-valued `platform` keys are treated as overrides.

---

## Overlay Layout

For ZStack-style stacking (loading overlays, floating buttons):

```json
{
  "type": "View",
  "id": "root",
  "child": [
    { "type": "View", "id": "main_content" },
    {
      "type": "View", "id": "loading_overlay",
      "visibility": "@{loadingVisibility}"
    }
  ]
}
```

When the spec has `overlay: true` in the layout, children are stacked (no `orientation`) with optional `zIndex` for ordering.

---

## Cross-Platform

The same JSON works on:
- SwiftJsonUI (iOS)
- KotlinJsonUI (Android)
- ReactJsonUI (Web)

`jui build` distributes from the shared `layouts_directory` to each platform, resolving `platform` overrides.

---

## Handoff After Completion

After JSON layout is complete, report the list of bindings used (`@{email}`, `@{onLoginTap}`, etc.).
